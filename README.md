# VideoPeers - Real Time P2P Video Chat Application

## Description

This is a real time video chat application built using WebRTC, Socket.io, Node.js, Express.js, and Next.js. It allows users to create a room and share the room ID with other users to join the room for a peer-to-peer video call.

## How To Use : 
First of all join any room lets say 7 for example with your email and room no. as 7 and then notify other person to enter in room no. 7, now you will get call button on screen this will allow to call other person and then call will be initiated and other person will be having a button called Send Streams and as other person clicks Send Streams Button then video call will be initiated.

## My Learnings

By Building this project I learned about the following concepts:

- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables real-time peer-to-peer communication between browsers and mobile applications. It is an open-source and free project that used to provide web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs).

- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of: a Node.js server: Source | API. a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js): Source | API.

- Next.js is a React framework that enables several server-side rendering (SSR) features such as static site generation (SSG), automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and client-side routing. It is a framework that is built on top of React.js and Node.js.
